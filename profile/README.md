Welcome to the GitHub homepage of the  **Green Energy and Digital Processes Lab** led by **Prof.Sai Gu** at the **University of Warwick**. 

The **Green Energy & Digital Processes Lab**(GEDPL) focuses on the study of hydrogen energy with a focus on green hydrogen, pay closed attention to the engineered materials including electrodes, membranes, catalysts, and porous transport layer. By applying machine learning and virtural reality tools,we further enhance the impact of research and make it significant to change the daily life. By applying classical tools and further development with theories allows us the ability to discover the science.

Research in our lab focuses on three main aspects: measuring transport and structural properties by developing novel characterization tools, modeling transport processes and device performance using pore-scale simulations, and making customized materials targeted for specific applications based on the findings and results of the other two steps. We are also highly interested in visualization of porous materials using x-ray tomography, and extracting previously unimaginable information via quantitative analysis on the resultant volumetric images. This aspect of our work actually bridges all three of the main themes.

PMEAL is run by Prof. Jeff Gostick and is located at the University of Waterloo, in the Department of Chemical Engineering. For more information on the type of projects being pursued by the PMEAL team, take a look at the Publications page, or check out Prof. Gostickâ€™s Google Scholar page.

The GEDPL group develops several software packages for the analysis of hydrogen energy,to provide insights both on mechanism and public interest.
